# Business-Data-Management-Capstone-Project


The Capstone Project I undertook is directly aligned with my degree-level project on Business Data Management. The focus of my project was to analyze the sales data of a B2B garment shop located in Bihar for the financial year 2021-2022. Through meticulous data collection and thorough analysis, I aimed to gain insights into the business's performance.

By conducting monthly and quarterly analyses on the sales data, I was able to uncover several key findings. Specifically, I identified four objective problems that were impacting the business's operations and overall performance. These issues had significant implications for the shop's profitability and growth potential.

Based on my comprehensive analysis, I have developed recommendations to address these problems effectively. These solutions have been carefully formulated to leverage the insights gained from the data analysis and align with the specific challenges faced by the garment shop.

The significance of this Capstone Project lies in its potential to contribute to the improvement of the business's performance by providing data-driven solutions. Through the implementation of these recommendations, the garment shop can enhance its operations, optimize sales strategies, and ultimately improve its financial performance.

It is important to note that the findings and recommendations presented in this Capstone Project are based on the rigorous analysis of the sales data collected for the financial year 2021-2022. The results obtained serve as a foundation for decision-making and provide valuable insights for the business to address its challenges and drive future success.
